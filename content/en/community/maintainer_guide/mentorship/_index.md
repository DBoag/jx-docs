A maintainer is expected to help in increasing the adoption of Jenkins X and add new contributors.

Helping Jenkins X participate in internship opportunities is an excellent way to give Jenkins X more visibility and get new contributors.

These are the various internship programs that Jenkins X can participate in.

- Google summer of code
- Google season of docs
- Outreachy
- LFX mentorship

The Jenkins X Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) is responsible for keeping a list of projects year round.
This will help maintainers to float a project with less effort.

If you are interested in mentoring, please open a pull request in the jx-community repository with your project proposal.
