Jenkins X has participated in the Google Summer of code (GSoC) before.

This is the process that Jenkins X will follow when applying for GSoC (timelines are subject to change, check the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) section in the gsoc webpage).

- Publish a blog post announcing Jenkins X interest in applying to GSoC when the application is announced by Google
  - this normally happens in November
- Set a deadline when all project ideas are submitted for internal review by Jenkins X TOC
  - It's a good idea to set the deadline internally for project list submission to February 1.
    This is normally when the application opens for organizations.
    The application remain open only for 2 weeks, so it's better to have a list beforehand.
- Decide internally on a list of projects and the mentors that are interested.
  - Projects with multiple mentors are more likely to be shortlisted
- Once the application is announced by Google, publish a blog post with the project ideas. A sample is available [here](https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2022/02/20/gsoc2022-ideas/)
- Submit the application
- If selected by GSoC (results are announced in March), publish a follow up blog post.
  - This blog post is expected to help the GSoC applicants understand more about Jenkins X and what we are looking for in an ideal contributor. Check the [follow up blog from 2022](https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2022/03/12/gsoc2022-followup/) to get an idea.
  - It helps the contributors and the mentors if a project template is provided.
- After the project proposal deadline (April), decide on a list of contributors and rank the project proposals (the one at the top is the strongest proposal)
- Once Google announces the list of accepted proposals for Jenkins X (not all proposals ranked will get selected), mentors should discuss the project details (and time commitments) with the contributors.
