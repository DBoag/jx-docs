The Jenkins X project takes security seriously. We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins X platform and app developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins X in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins X in general.

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins X, please report it by sending an email to the [SECURITY maintainer mailing list](mailto:jenkins-x-admin@googlegroups.com).
Please **do not report security issues in the github** tracker.  

By restricting access to this potentially sensitive information, we can work on a fix and deliver it before the method of attack becomes well-known.

## Vulnerabilities in Apps

Whilst the Jenkins X team is not responsible for the quality of third party apps, please still use the above reporting mechanism and we will co-ordinate with the app developer to ensure a fix in a secure maner.
