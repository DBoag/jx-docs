We have made a short survey where we try to gain insight into how people experience Jenkins X. This is meant to be used as guidelines going forward so we can be more focused on what areas to improve.

All contributions are welcome, if you are just browsing or have used it for years, we want to know you all!

We have extended the survey period and it will now be open untill Tuesday February 11 2022 midnight UTC. All submissions are anonymous and the results will be published. So don't hesitate, fill in the [Jenkins X survey](https://forms.office.com/r/mWD6Ruzu8C) today
