We are excited to announce that Jenkins X will be participating in Hacktoberfest again this year!
Hacktoberfest is a month-long global celebration of open source software.

All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to participate in Hacktoberfest and join a global community of open source contributors.

**Learn more about Hacktoberfest and sign up [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).**

### Contribute to Jenkins X

We welcome your contributions to the [Jenkins X project](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx)!

[Issues labelled "hacktoberfest"](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest+is%3Aopen) generally indicate good first issues.
However, all pull requests will count towards your Hacktoberfest challenge.

Refer to the contribution guides for making [code](https://jenkins-x.io/community/code/) and [documentation](https://jenkins-x.io/community/documentation/) changes.

Refer to [this document](https://jenkins-x.io/v3/about/overview/source/) to get an idea about the location of the different Jenkins X source code repositories.
Normally the labels assigned to the ticket will help you in deciding which part of the Jenkins X codebase to look at.
The maintainers will also try to link the relevant repository for hacktoberfest issues in the issue comment.

Once you are done with the contribution, request a review from the maintainers by adding the comment in your pull request.

```bash
/cc @ankitm123 @babadofar @msvticket @osamamagdy @rajatgupta24 @tomhobson
```
