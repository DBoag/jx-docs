We have put together some project ideas as part of our application to participate in the Google Season of Docs 2022 program.

### Project ideas

#### 1. Better documentation for real world use cases

##### Problem

- End users of Jenkins X are unable to find information on how to use Jenkins X for real world use cases which includes:
  - Production best practices
  - Scanning images in Jenkins X pipelines
  - How to make your app use different configuration/secrets for each environment
  - Observability for your apps, logging, metrics, tracing
  - Tests (Integration, e2e)
  - Artifact management
  - Multi cluster
  - Integration with other tools in the cloud native sector

##### How would we measure success?

- Decrease in the number of github issues raised by end users on documentation related to common real world use cases
- Short 1-2 minute videos on common tasks that end users of Jenkins X would like to perform.

##### Recommended skills

- Must have:
  - Experience with github
  - Communication skills to work with and within the Jenkins X community
- Nice to have: Basic experience with docker compose (local development scripts use compose) and video editing skills.

##### Mentors/Volunteers

- [Ankit D Mohapatra](https://github.com/ankitm123)
- [Christoffer Vig](https://github.com/babadofar)
- [Mårten Svantesson](https://github.com/msvticket)
- [Tom Hobson](https://github.com/tomhobson)

#### 2. Reorganize documentation to make it more user friendly and easy to search

##### Problem

- The documentation does not feel coherent, it does not read like a book from start to finish
  - There's no clear flow about how people should read documentation and no "next step" once they've finished reading a page.
  - There's also a lot of missing _assumed_ knowledge in the documentation which makes it hard for new users to form a mental picture of Jenkins X
- Results from older documentation sometimes shows up higher than newer results creating confusion for users

##### How would we measure success?

- The number of repeated searches decrease (adding / removing terms)
- Decrease in the number of github issues raised by users on documentation related to missing information
- Decrease in slack messages from users not finding relevant information in the documentation.

##### Recommended skills

- Must have:
  - Experience with github
  - Experience with organizing documentation
  - Communication skills to work with and within the Jenkins X community
- Nice to have:
  - Basic experience with docker compose (local development scripts use compose)
  - Experience working with and tuning relevancy for search engines

##### Mentors/Volunteers

- [Mårten Svantesson](https://github.com/msvticket)

#### 3. Improve contributor/developer documentation on how to extend Jenkins X

##### Problem

- It is not clear from our documentation how to
  - add support for a new cloud provider
  - add support for a new git/scm provider
  - add a new quick start
  - add new language packs

##### How would we measure success?

- Increase in number of contributions to add support for more cloud providers
- Increase in number of contributions to add add or extend quickstart guides
- Decrease in slack messages from users not finding relevant information in the documentation.

##### Recommended skills

- Must have:
  - Experience with github
  - Communication skills to work with and within the Jenkins X community
- Nice to have: Basic experience with docker compose (local development scripts use compose)
