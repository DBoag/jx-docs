The Jenkins X survey was active for four weeks and closed on February 11 2022. We received lots of valuable insights into how people are using Jenkins X. We need more contributors in the Jenkins X community, so if you feel strongly about how Jenkins X should evolve, your best bet is to dive in and get your hands dirty:) Some highlights of the free text responses we got are collected [here](/blog/2022/02/15/survey-1-result-details-2022/)

According to the survey, a typical Jenkinx X user works with Devops and Software Engineering

She finds it somewhat difficult to find documentation, average 2.9 out of 5 ![Find documentation](/images/survey-2022-1/hard-to-find-information.png)

 The Jenkins X user tries to find information mainly on the main web site, sometimes on slack and less often on github. ![Information sources](/images/survey-2022-1/where-information.png)
What he enjoys most about  Jenkins X is that it is an easy way to learn, play around and work with Kubernetes. The git(ops(ish)) style of configuration, the preview environments, and the staging /production environments. ![Enjoy the most](/images/survey-2022-1/enjoy-most.png)


But one thing is sure, documentation is confusing and shold be improved. ![Should be improved](/images/survey-2022-1/improving.png)

The typical Jenkins X user would like to run Jenkins X offline, either to run on a laptop, or behind a (corporate) firewall. Proper support for multi-tenancy would be nice, and who can ignore security in these times.  A clear governance of Jenkins X needs to be established, 

The typical person who answers surveys on Jenkins X *is* planning to attend Jenkins X Office hours, which is great!
