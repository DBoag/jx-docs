[Hacktoberfest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is over, and we got quite a few contributions from the open source community.

Contributions included various document improvements, adding jira as an issue tracker for generating changelogs and adding initial support for external vault!

The top contributors to Jenkins X in hacktoberfest 2021 were:

- Marten Svantesson
- Christopher vig
- James Rawlings
- Hays Clark
- Anatoli Babenia

We would also like to thank all the contributors who participated and made it a success.
The strength of Jenkins X lies in it's vast community, and we hope to see many more major contributions from them in the near and far future.
